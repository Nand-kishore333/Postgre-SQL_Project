🎧 PostgreSQL SQL Practice – Music Library Project
Hey there! This is a small project I made to practice SQL using a music library database (kind of like the Chinook dataset). I used PostgreSQL to write and test all the queries.

It's a great way to get better at SQL — whether you're prepping for interviews, building your portfolio, or just want some hands-on experience with real database stuff.

📌 What's This Project About?
This project includes several .sql files, each focused on different SQL concepts. All the queries are based on a music store database, with tables like:

Customers

Invoices

Artists

Albums

Tracks

Genres

These tables are connected in ways you'd expect — like customer purchases, music metadata, and so on.

📁 What's Inside the Repo?
File Name	What's In It
Select.sql	Basic SELECT queries
Where.sql	Filtering with WHERE
GroupBy.sql	Grouping data and using aggregates
Having.sql	Filtering grouped results
Joins.sql	INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, etc.
Subquery.sql	Subqueries in SELECT, FROM, WHERE
Aggregation.sql	Using SUM, COUNT, AVG, MIN, MAX
Each file has real examples to show how these concepts work in everyday scenarios.

🎯 Why I Made This
To get better at writing SQL with PostgreSQL

To understand database schemas more clearly

To build confidence for interviews or job tasks

To work with a realistic database structure

🛠️ Tools I Used
PostgreSQL

pgAdmin / DBeaver (any SQL client works)

Music Store Dataset (Chinook or something similar)

🚀 How to Try It Out
Clone the repo:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/Nand-kishore333/Postgre-SQL_Project.git
Load the sample music database into PostgreSQL.

Open the .sql files in your SQL editor and run the queries.

📚 What You Can Try With These Queries
Get total revenue by country

Find top-selling genres or artists

List customers who purchased the most tracks

Use joins to connect invoices, customers, and tracks

Practice subqueries to find popular albums or average purchase values
