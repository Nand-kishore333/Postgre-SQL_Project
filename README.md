# 🎧 PostgreSQL SQL Practice Project – Music Library Dataset

Welcome to my PostgreSQL practice project, where I explore and apply key SQL concepts using a **real-world music library database** (similar to the Chinook dataset).

This repository is structured to demonstrate practical SQL skills — ideal for interview prep, portfolio projects, or anyone interested in relational databases.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project contains SQL files organized by key query topics, each written and tested using **PostgreSQL**.  
The queries are based on a music store database, which includes tables such as:

- `Customer`
- `Invoice`
- `Artist`
- `Album`
- `Track`
- `Genre`

These reflect real-world data relationships like music purchases, customer info, and track metadata.

## 📁 Repository Structure

| File Name         | Description                                     |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| `Select.sql`      | Basic SELECT queries                           |
| `Where.sql`       | Filtering rows using WHERE conditions          |
| `GroupBy.sql`     | Grouping data and using aggregate functions     |
| `Having.sql`      | Filtering grouped data                         |
| `Joins.sql`       | Using INNER, LEFT, and other JOIN types        |
| `Subquery.sql`    | Using subqueries in SELECT, FROM, WHERE clauses|
| `Aggregation.sql` | SUM, COUNT, AVG, MIN, MAX, etc.                |

Each file contains practical examples and query logic built around realistic data use-cases.

## 🎯 Goals

- Strengthen SQL query writing with PostgreSQL
- Practice reading and interpreting database schemas
- Build confidence in SQL for data analysis and interviews
- Explore a normalized database schema with multiple relationships

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- PostgreSQL
- pgAdmin / DBeaver (recommended for testing queries)
- Music Store Dataset (Chinook or similar)

---

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Nand-kishore333/Postgre-SQL_Project.git
Load the music store database in PostgreSQL (you can use the Chinook sample DB).

Open the .sql files in any SQL client and run the queries one by one.

📚 Sample Use Cases Covered
